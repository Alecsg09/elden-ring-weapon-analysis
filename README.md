# Elden Ring Weapon Efficiency Analysis ⚔️

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the efficiency of starter weapons in Elden Ring, focusing on the "Damage-to-Weight" ratio. The goal is to identify which combat builds (Strength vs. Dexterity) offer the best performance for early-game players.

## Skills Demonstrated
* **Data Cleaning & Manipulation:** Handled decimal formatting and calculated new metrics in Excel.
* **SQL Querying:** Used SQLite to perform aggregations (`GROUP BY`, `AVG`) and sorting.
* **Data Visualization:** Created an analytical dashboard to present insights.

## Key Insights
* **Dexterity Builds** showed a significantly higher average efficiency (**26.25**) compared to **Strength Builds** (**17.96**).
* The **Reduvia** dagger was identified as the most efficient weapon in the sample.

## How to Run the Analysis
1. Check the `analysis_queries.sql` file for the SQL logic.
